## Slow update - Partially Deprecated
This agent is slowly being updated to Mythic 2.3 and might or might not have periodic updates over time. However, there is currently no identified maintainer for the project. The Mythic side of things has been updated for Mythic 2.3.7, but there are issues currently in the Nim side of things.

![Nimplant](agent_icons/nimplant.svg)

Nimplant is a cross-platform (Linux & Windows) implant written in Nim as a fun project to learn about Nim and see what it can bring to the table for red team tool development. Currently, Nimplant lacks extensive evasive tradecraft; however, overtime Nimplant will become much more sophisticated.


## Installation
To install Nimplant, you'll need Mythic installed on a remote computer. You can find installation instructions for Mythic at the [Mythic project page](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic/).

From the Mythic install root, run the command:

`sudo ./mythic-cli install github https://github.com/MythicAgents/Nimplant v2.3`


### Highlighted Agent Features
- Cross-platform
- Fully asynchronous
- Can generate agents compiled from both C and C++ source code

## Supported C2 Profiles

Currently, only one C2 profile is available to use when creating a new Nimplant agent: HTTP.

### HTTP Profile

The HTTP profile calls back to the Mythic server over the basic, non-dynamic profile. When selecting options to be stamped into Nimplant at compile time, all options are respected with the exception of those parameters relating to GET requests.
